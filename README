About IDNA
===============================================================================

Idna is currently in pre-alpha stage, and might not leave this state. It is
programmed with D2, version 2.046, which is still an alpha compiler.

IDNA is a personal framework, a hybrid of Phobos and Tango, that I use in my D
programs along with phobos2 as standard/base libraries.
